# BioCatHub

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.7.

## Dependencies

To run BioCatHub you will need some external dependencies, which have to be installed by yourself. Angular CLI is very supportive for that. In addition here are some useful links for dependencies that lead to errors in the past.

### plotly.js-dist

To install plotly.js-dist the following two links are very helpful. The [npm documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plotly.js-dist) and the [git repository](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
